# Start developing An App in 30 days



Recently I have tried to build a app from a prototype we break out two years ago. The boys and girls worked hard together for a common target.

This is my technology choices:

1. backend: ruby on rails
2. frontend: framework7
3. native: ionic
	
Next time I will try react-native.
